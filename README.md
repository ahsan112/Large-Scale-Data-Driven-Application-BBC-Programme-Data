# Large Scale Data Driven Application - BBC Programme Data.

### Objective:
> The objective was to develop an application that could query and display BBC programme data in a intelligent way. e.g searching for a tv show should display the season and episodes in reverse chronological order, searching for the news should display the most recent news broadcast first etc. The application was driven by large amounts of data and had to be scalable as the scenario involved adding new data every 2 weeks.
